		<h2>Milestone Progress</h2>
		So far, we have implemented several mesh operations that will be used for various 
		remeshing techniques, including vertex shift, fill missing faces, remove degenerate 
		triangles, and edge collapse. We started our project from homework 2, where we 
		had implemented edge flip and edge split. These additional operations will be 
		crucial for remeshing and repairing 
		malformed meshes. We also have implemented 2 remeshing algorithms so far: 
		Incremental remeshing and Pixellate remeshing.
		

		<h2>Mesh Operations</h2>
		Vertex shift helps to regularize meshes by moving 
		vertices towards the average of their neighbors. Specifically, a correction 
		vector is created between a vertex and the average of its neighbors, scaled 
		by a factor of lambda between 0 and 1, and finally applied to the original 
		position of the vertex. This algorithm can also be used in succession. 
		Below is an example of 0, 1, and 5 iterations of this vertex shift algorithm.

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="img/vs0.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>0 iterations</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="img/vs1.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>1 iteration</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="img/vs5.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>5 iterations</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		As mentioned above, we also added a function which will scan a mesh and attempt to fill any missing 
		faces, assuming the mesh is intended to be airtight. Next, we implemented a 
		function that will fix a degenerate face on a mesh (a face with 0 area) by 
		removing the face and adjusting any adjacent geometry. This function makes 
		use of the edge collapse operation with a special case for updating vertex 
		positions. This will be useful for handling poorly formed meshes with our 
		remeshing operations.
		
		<h2>Remeshing Algorithms</h2>
		We have added implementations of Incremental remeshing, which is an isotropic 
		remeshing algorithm, meaning it is applied equally at all areas of the mesh.
		We also made a preliminary implementation of a 
		pixellate remesher, which turns an existing mesh into a pixellated version 
		which appears to be made up of small cubes. An example of the pixellation remesh 
		algorithm is shown below, and another example can be found in our video.

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="img/cow0.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Cow</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="img/cow1.png" width="300px"/>
				  <figcaption>Pixellated cow</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		Both of these algorithms are functional, but need additional debugging and optimization. 
		The pixellate function is inefficient right now, and also generates some unnecessary 
		geometry. Moving forward, our first goal will to make sure both of these operations 
		are fully functional and optimized. Then, we hope to update the pixellate remesher 
		to allow for real time modification of the voxel size as well as real time updates 
		to modifications of the underlying mesh. We will also be adding more remeshing algorithms,
		starting with quadric error mesh simplification. We would also like 
		to implement an adaptive remeshing algorithm, which changes how it remeshes different 
		parts of a surface based on the curvature and complexity of the mesh in that area. 
		If we have time, we will look into more real-time remeshing algorithms that could 
		be useful with creating realistic looking deformations in animation. We have 
		kept up with our planned progress so far, and are looking forward to adding 
		more functionality.
